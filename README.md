# katas
This repo is a collection of katas and programming exercises. Each folder contains a kata description and sometimes an implementation or two.

> A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

I see value in repetition. I also agree that much of the value comes from having a new challenge to think through, whether that is a new implementation of the same problem or a new problem altogether.

> If you want to get better at something, repeating practice alone is not enough. You must practice with increased difficulty and challenge. - [Why I Don't Do Code Katas](https://hackhands.com/dont-code-katas/)
